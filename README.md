This is a fork of https://github.com/micahmo/twitch2tuner that:

    adjusts the date format of the EPG to suit Jelly Fin Media servers date formats
    adjust the schedules of each twitch channel to
        pull their schedule
        assume that a live stream is only 3 hrs long, not 24 hrs

Michamo deserves the real credit for this work and this fork is likely to eventually be deprecated as things are contributed back
